# Survival Analysis of Telecom Customer Churn

## Project Overview

This project applies survival analysis to a telecom dataset to identify the factors influencing customer churn. Using parametric models, we assess customers' lifetime value (CLV), examine survival probabilities, and explore strategies for improving customer retention. The project is structured around an assignment that includes building Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) models, comparing their effectiveness, and calculating the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) based on these models.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes information on subscribers from a telecom company with the following attributes:
- **ID**: Unique subscriber ID
- **Region**: Region code
- **Tenure**: Lifetime of the subscription in months
- **Age**: Subscriber's age
- **Marital Status**: Marital status of the subscriber
- **Address**: Number of years the subscriber has lived at the same address
- **Income**: Annual income of the subscriber in thousand dollars
- **Education**: Education level of the subscriber

- **Gender**: Gender of the subscriber
- **Service Usage**: Various attributes related to service usage like voice, internet, and call forwarding
- **Customer Category**: Categorization of customers based on service usage
